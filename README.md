[Gift Radar](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-DEy4xd8xr-gift-radar) is a specialized tool designed to assist users in finding the perfect gifts for various recipients based on their preferences and needs. Whether you're shopping for yourself, family members, friends, or coworkers, Gift Radar simplifies the process by tailoring gift suggestions to the specific requirements of each situation. By considering factors such as the recipient's age group, the occasion, and budget constraints, Gift Radar offers a curated selection of both mass-produced and handmade items, ensuring a unique and thoughtful choice every time.

Gift Radar can be particularly helpful in navigating the vast array of options available online and in stores, streamlining the search process to save time and enhance gift-giving experiences. For instance, when looking for a gift for a coworker with a maximum budget, Gift Radar will ask targeted questions about the recipient's interests and preferences. Based on this information, it then compiles a list of suitable products from popular retailers like Amazon or Walmart, as well as unique, handmade items from platforms like Etsy or Facebook Marketplace.

An example usage of Gift Radar could be someone looking for a birthday gift for their grandparent. After specifying that the gift is for a grandparent and setting a budget, the user might choose a product category such as "wellness". Gift Radar would then present a list of five mass-produced items such as a comfortable robe from Amazon or a foot massager from Best Buy, along with five handmade products like a custom-engraved wooden photo frame from Etsy or a handmade throw blanket from a local artisan. This approach not only offers personalized options but also supports a range of sellers, from large retailers to individual craftspeople.
